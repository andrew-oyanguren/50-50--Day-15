### General Info
This project was really cool, and was great practice using the date/time api. I have used it before, but this was just a fun project. 
I also designed my first dark and light modes, and this one was very simple as there was only two color variables that needed to be changed, but it was a great intro to 
start incorporting themes into my designs.
